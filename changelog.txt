Dormer: 3.2.20 (3.2.20_dormer) / Danvers: 4.0.20-alpha1 (4.0.20_danvers)

ARCTIC ZEPHYR: FROM ASHES ANNIVERSARY EDITION (DANVERS) IS IN EARLY PREVIEW AND FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT A GUARANTEE. FEEDBACK ON THE DANVERS RELEASES WILL ALLOW FOR A BETTER TRANSITION FROM JARVIS (KODI 16) TO KRYPTON (KODI 17).

The "Summer 2016 Update" to Arctic Zephyr: From Ashes will conclude the "General Availability" status of the Dormer - Jarvis (Kodi 16) line of From Ashes. The Dormer (3.x) line will transition to Long Term Support (LTS) status and receive only bugfixes. As of this release, the "Danvers" line (4.x) will enter "Preview Availability." You may continue using the Dormer - Jarvis line until you are ready to update to Kodi 17 Krypton.
